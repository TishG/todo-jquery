## About
This is an application where users can create their todos. 
* The user can click on the pencil icon to show or hide the list
* User can add a to do by clicking on the "Add New Todo" box
* User can delete a todo by hovering over the todo until the red trash icon appears and clicking on it
* If user tries to add a new todo that is blank, it won't add to the list of todos.

## How
This app was built using:
* HTML
* CSS
* JQuery
* Bootstrap

I integrated bootstrao into this application to make it viewable on all screen sizes and devices. I chose my background from uigradients.com.

## Where
How you can view this application:

Option 1. 
GitHub page - https://tishg.github.io/todo-jquery/

Option 2. 
View on your local device:
1. Under the repository name, click the green "Clone or download" button
2. Copy the clone URL for the repository
3. Open Git Bash, you may [download Git Bash here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
4. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
5. In the command line, type "git clone", and then paste the copied URL
6. Go to your file explorer
7. Click on the folder where the application is located and then navigate to the index.js file 
8. Right click on index.js and select "Open with" and choose "Google Chrome".

## Follow-up
The application does not currently persist data. I would like to incorporate a back end in the future so that the users can sign in, sign out, and save their todo list.
